What is Infrastructure as Code?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) 
in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as DevOps team uses for source code.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes.

With IaC, configuration files are created that contain your infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations. 
It also ensures that you provision the same environment every time.
	
Benefits of IaC:

- Cost reduction.
- Increase in speed of deployments
- Reduce errors 
- Improve infrastructure consistency
- Eliminate configuration drift
- IaC tool examples

Server automation and configuration management tools can often be used to achieve IaC. 

These are a few popular choices:
- Chef
- Puppet
- Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
- Saltstack
- Terraform 
- AWS CloudFormation
