Git is a free, open source distributed version control system tool designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 
It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to develop Linux Kernel. 
Git has the functionality, performance, security and flexibility that most teams and individual developers need. 
It also serves as an important distributed version-control DevOps tool.
